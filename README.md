# Here are your Instructions

Action: Based on my analysis of the InteLLItEST application, here's my understanding and plan:

## Current Status:
The InteLLItEST AI-powered testing platform has been partially developed with:
- ✅ Frontend React structure with components for Test Cases, AI Test Generation, Visual Testing, etc.
- ✅ Backend FastAPI architecture with modular structure created
- ✅ Database models, AI services, and route files scaffolded
- ✅ OpenAI API integration prepared

## Immediate Next Steps - My Plan:

### Phase 1: Backend Integration & Testing
1. **Read test_result.md** to understand testing protocols and previous communications
2. **Integrate backend modules** into `server.py`:
   - Import and register all route modules (projects, test_cases, ai_routes, etc.)
   - Initialize database connection
   - Set up AI service integration
3. **Test backend thoroughly** using `deep_testing_backend_v2` agent
4. **Fix any backend issues** identified during testing

### Phase 2: Frontend Integration (After Backend is Working)
1. **Update frontend components** to connect with new backend APIs
2. **Implement UI logic** for all the testing features
3. **Ask for your permission** before running frontend testing
4. **Test frontend** (only if you approve) using appropriate testing tools

### Phase 3: End-to-End Validation
1. **Verify all features work together**
2. **Address any integration issues**
3. **Provide comprehensive summary** of implemented functionalities

## Important Notes:
- Since this is a forked environment, backend/frontend URLs might need adjustment
- I'll strictly follow the testing protocols in test_result.md
- I'll ask for your explicit permission before any frontend testing
- All backend routes will use '/api' prefix for proper Kubernetes routing

**Questions for you:**
1. Are you aligned with this phased approach?
2. Do you want me to proceed with Phase 1 (backend integration and testing) first?
3. Are there any specific features or priorities you'd like me to focus on?
4. Should I check for any URL/environment issues due to forking before starting?

**Important Forking Note:** Forking creates a new environment. If you've integrated any services that use the preview URL (e.g., https://**.preview.emergentagent.com/), we recommend updating it to the new preview URL. Failing to do so may cause your application to stop working properly.
